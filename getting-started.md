## Audience

This manual is written for small business owners and corporate
administrators who find using DXU to configure and upgrade Datalogic
mobile computers that run the Android and/or Windows Embedded Compact 7 operating systems. End users of
Datalogic’s mobile computers can usually change settings on the device
in their hands. Larger corporate administrators will likely resort to
MDM tools that can remotely configure and update large groups of mobile
devices at many sites simultaneously, such as Wavelink Avalanche and
42Gears SureMDM.

## Conventions

Datalogic mobile computers will often be referred to generically as “the
device” in this manual.

Personal computers which run any of a variety of Windows operating
systems will often be referred to as a “PC.”

**Application controls** are highlighted in **boldface** for
